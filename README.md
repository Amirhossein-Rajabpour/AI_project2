# Genetic-Algorithm
Artificial Intelligence Course 2nd Project: Implementing genetic algorithm in order to solve Super Mario game
<br>
In this group project we ([Amirhossein-Rajabpour](https://github.com/Amirhossein-Rajabpour) and [arminZolfaghari](https://github.com/arminZolfaghari)) implemented genetic algorithm to solve Super-Mario game.<br>
Mario can jump, go straigh or dodge. Mario must jump over Goomba and must dodge when it reaches Lakito. If Mario jumps 2 step before Goomba it can kill Goomba and then it gets more points.
If Mario jumps when it reaches at the end of the board it gets more points (but it's adjustable).
